Things it might be nice to do someday.  I haven't evaluated all of
these suggestions... their presence here doesn't imply my endorsement.

* Create a base class mgsolver and poissonsolver a derived class
  DONE

* Add capability of multi-fluid Boltzmann distribution in the
BoltzmannPoisson solver. Application: dusty plasmas/dust in plasma

* Add capability of (multi-)fluid Kappa distribution (see Hau and Fu, 
  Mathematical and physical aspects of Kappa velocity distribution, 
	Phys. Plasmas, 14, 110702, 2007)
